# AI Coding Standards

A personal collection of AI prompts, operating modes, and rules designed to streamline development and ensure high-quality code through AI collaboration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Copy commands to your IDE:

```text
Cursor: `.cursor/commands/`
Claude Code: `.claude/commands/`  
Use slash commands: /general-helper Let's plan a new feature called "Task Management System"
```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `commands/`: Markdown-based command definitions (e.g., `spec-assistant.md`).
- `rules/`: (Coming Soon) Standardized rules for testing, style, and workflow.
